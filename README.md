C language codes

During the third year of high school integrated with the computer technician, I was intensively studying the knowledge of programming logic during the first bimester. In order to master this subject well during school time, my teacher used to pass several exercises in the C language. Even though it is an old language, this language helped me to master my logic a lot. In this specific repository, I will put most of the code that I did during that period.
